# DeepDream-implementation
DeepDream is an experiment that visualizes the patterns learned by a neural network. Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image. In this project, I used TensorFlow library and resources for transforming the pattern s of the dog.
